Simplistic algorithms to train decision trees for regression and classification

> **NOTE:**  These pure python (and a bit of numpy) algorithms are many times slower than, e.g., `sklearn` or `xgboost`.

## Principle
Decision trees are, by design, data type agnostic. With only a few methods like a 'spliter' for input variables and meaningful quantification for 'losses', any data type can be perused. In this code, this is implemented using a factory pattern for data handling and metrics making decision tree learing simple and versatile.

## Example

Load the Classification And Regression Tree model class

```
from binarybeech.binarybeech import CART
```
get the data from a csv file
```
df_titanic = pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
```
grow a decision tree
```
c = CART(df_titanic,"Survived", metrics_type="classification")
c.create_tree()
```
predict
```
p = c.predict(df_titanic)
```
validation metrics
```
val = c.validate()
```
